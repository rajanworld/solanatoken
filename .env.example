# Solana Token Creator - Environment Example
# Copy this file to .env and edit values as needed.
# Vite exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the frontend.

# Which Solana cluster to use by default in the app UI.
# Options: devnet | testnet | mainnet-beta
VITE_SOLANA_CLUSTER=devnet

# Optional: Custom RPC URL. Leave empty to use the default public endpoint for the selected cluster.
# Recommended to set this for reliability/speed, especially on mainnet.
# Examples:
# - Helius: https://rpc.helius.xyz/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
# - QuickNode: https://purple-misty-dawn.solana-mainnet.quiknode.pro/YOUR_KEY/
# - Triton: https://api.triton.one/solana/mainnet/YOUR_KEY
# - Ankr: https://rpc.ankr.com/solana
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=

# Optional: NFT.Storage API token used to upload your token metadata JSON to IPFS.
# If not set, the app falls back to an inline data URI (works, but some explorers might not display rich metadata).
# Get a free API key here: https://nft.storage
VITE_NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN=

# Optional: App service fee configuration
# If VITE_SERVICE_FEE_RECIPIENT is set, the app will add a transfer at the start of the transaction based on the
# selected options below. All fee amounts are in lamports (1 SOL = 1_000_000_000 lamports).

# Recipient public key (base58) to receive the service fee.
VITE_SERVICE_FEE_RECIPIENT=

# Base fee always charged on token creation (optional)
VITE_FEE_BASE_LAMPORTS=0

# Feature-based optional fees (enter 0 to disable)
# Applied when user enables "Revoke Mint Authority"
VITE_FEE_REVOKE_MINT_LAMPORTS=0
# Applied when user enables "Revoke Freeze Authority"
VITE_FEE_REVOKE_FREEZE_LAMPORTS=0
